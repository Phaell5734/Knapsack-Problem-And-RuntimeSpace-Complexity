JavaApplication6 is for little datasets.JavaApplication3 is for bigger datasets cause it is made by using 1 Array DP Table.It is tricky to make it so that it gives weights cause of 1 Array DP Table.JavaApplication5 gives you datasets weights etc. in a .csv file so you can use it in a python code.pythonProject3 takes those in .csv file and builds a graph out of them so you can make comments on graphs.I share an example dataset here.First line left side shows total of rows in dataset.First line right side shows total weight that it shouldnt pass.
